EQdyna.2Dcycle is a finite element method (FEM) code to simulate physics-based 
earthquake dynamic ruptures, earthquake cycles and seismic ground shaking.

It features: 
	*Finite element method for earthquake multicyle dynamics 
	*Geometrically realistic fault systems
	*Automatically mesh generation given controlling points of fault geometries
	*Flexable standalone input files for various physical conditions
	*Under-integreated quadrilateral stablized by hourglass control and degenerated triangles
